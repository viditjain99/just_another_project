#Assembler project

We have partially designed an assembler which will take an assembly code as input, and will output 
the machine code, in a seperate text file.

We have assumed this format for the assembly language program.
Label/symbol    Opcode    Operands	Comments

Also, each section will be seperated by tabspace(\t). 
If not, our code will generate runtime errors.

We have generated the Symbol table, Literal Table, Opcode table and some errors.

We have a problem when an immediate address is used as a symbol, so our program won't be able to 
decide that it is a literal or an address.

We have handled these errors- 
1) When an opcode is not given
2) Opcode is invalid (opcode is not present in the given set of opcodes)
3) An opcode is used as a symbol
4) A symbol is defined more than once
5) Opcode is supplied with too many operands
6) Opcode is supplied with less number of operands than required
7) STP statement not used

We are yet to handle the error that a symbol is used which has not been defined. It will be done
when we write the code for pass2.
